# infix-mathematical-expression-to-postfix
This C++ program converts an infix mathematical expression to its postfix form and evaluates it for a given range of values. It utilizes a stack-based approach to handle operator precedence and perform calculations efficiently.\
Key Features:\
•	Stack Implementation: A templated stack class manages operands and operators.\
•	Infix to Postfix Conversion: The intopo function converts a given mathematical expression from infix notation to postfix notation.\
•	Postfix Evaluation: The postfixcal function evaluates the postfix expression for a given value of x.\
•	Mathematical Operations: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), exponentiation (^), negation (#), and factorial (!).\
•	Recursive Power Function: The tav function efficiently calculates exponentiation using recursion.
•	User Interaction: Accepts a function, range [a, b], and number of divisions n, then computes and prints f(x) for equidistant points in the range.\
